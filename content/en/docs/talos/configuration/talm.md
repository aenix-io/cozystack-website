[Talm](https://github.com/aenix-io/talm) is a Helm-like utility for declarative configuration management of Talos Linux.

It was created by Ã†nix to allow more declarative and custom configurations for cluster management.

Talm comes with pre-built presets for Cozystack.

Initialize the new project:

```
mkdir -p cluster1
cd cluster1
talm init --preset cozystack
```

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
If you use keycloak.

From v0.6.6 Talm:
- in `cluster1/templates/_helpers.tpl` replace  `keycloak.example.com` to your domain.

Before v0.6.6 Talm:
- Add in template args manualy:
```
  cluster:
    apiServer:
    apiServer:
      extraArgs:
      oidc-issuer-url: "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/cozy"
      oidc-client-id: "kubernetes"
      oidc-username-claim: "preferred_username"
      oidc-groups-claim: "groups"

The structure of the project mostly mirrors an ordinary Helm chart:

- `charts` - a directory that includes a common library chart with functions used for querying information from Talos Linux.
- `Chart.yaml` - a file containing the common information about your project; the name of the chart is used as the name for the newly created cluster.
- `templates` - a directory used to describe templates for the configuration generation.
- `secrets.yaml` - a file containing secrets for your cluster.
- `values.yaml` - a common values file used to provide parameters for the templating.
- `nodes` - an optional directory used to describe and store generated configuration for nodes.

You're free to edit the files: `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and `templates/*` to meet your environment requirements.

Be aware that your nodes are booted Talos Linux image and awaiting in maintenance mode

If you are using DHCP, you might not be aware of the IP addresses assigned to your nodes.\
You can use nmap to find them all:

```bash
nmap -Pn -n -p 50000 192.168.100.0/24 -vv | grep 'Discovered'
```

Where `192.168.100.0/24` is your network.

Example output:

```
Discovered open port 50000/tcp on 192.168.100.63
Discovered open port 50000/tcp on 192.168.100.159
Discovered open port 50000/tcp on 192.168.100.192
```
{{% /alert %}}

Now, create a nodes directory and collect the information from your node into a specific file:

```bash
talm template -e 192.168.100.63 -n 192.168.100.63 -t templates/controlplane.yaml -i > nodes/srv1.yaml
```

Where `192.168.100.63` is the IP address of your node.

Check the generated file, and if everything is okay, apply it:

```bash
talm apply -f nodes/srv1.yaml -i
```
In future operations, you can also use the following options:

- `--dry-run` - dry run mode will show a diff with the existing configuration.
- `-m try` - try mode will rollback the configuration in 1 minute.

```bash
talm bootstrap -f nodes/srv1.yaml
```

To access the cluster, generate an admin kubeconfig:

```bash
talm kubeconfig kubeconfig -f nodes/srv1.yaml
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig
```

Now follow **Get Started** guide starting from the [**Install Cozystack**](/docs/get-started/#install-cozystack) section, to continue the installation.
