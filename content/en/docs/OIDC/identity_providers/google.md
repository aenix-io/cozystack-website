- Once the project is created you will get a pop-up suggesting to configure the consent screen. If not then head over to the Dashboard and head over to "Explore and enable APIs" options. Then Click on "Credentials" > "Configure Consent Screen" and head over to the next step.

- After this, we will be redirected to pages where we will have to configure different things
    - Application type: Public
    - Application name: Your application name
    - Authorised domains: Your application top-level domain name
    - Application Homepage link: Your application homepage
    - Application Privacy Policy link: Your application privacy policy link

- Now head over to the Create Credentials option in the navbar and click on "OAuth Client ID".

- Select Application type as a "Web application" and name the application according to your choice. Next, Add the link provided in the Keycloak tab under "Authorized Redirect URIs" and click "Create". The link should look something like this
```bash
https://YOUR_KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN/auth/realms/cozy/broker/google/endpoint
```

- As it is done, you will see a pop up with the information required in the next step. You will need to "Client ID" and "Client secret" in next step so make sure you make a safe copy of it.

  authenticateByDefault: false
  enabled: true
  providerId: "google"

    clientId: "YOUR GOOGLE APP ID"
    clientSecret: "YOUR GOOGLE APP SECRET"
    syncMode: "IMPORT"
  mappers:
    - name: "username"
      identityProviderMapper: "oidc-username-idp-mapper"
      identityProviderAlias: "google"
      config:
        target: "LOCAL"
        syncMode: "INHERIT"
        template: "${ALIAS}---${CLAIM.email}"
```
