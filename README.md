## Install hugo

Be sure to download the extended version of Hugo from the GitHub releases page. The binary that was installed by your
operating system package manager may (and most likely will) not work correctly.

```bash
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.122.0/hugo_extended_0.122.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf hugo_extended_0.122.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
 chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hugo
```

## Run docs

```bash
hugo serve
```
